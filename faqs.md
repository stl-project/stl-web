### What is Spread the Love?
<hr/>

[*Angry people click more*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rage_farming) has become the motto of social media conglomerates. Social media has become a machinary producing angry people: the more anger, the more clicks, the more advertising sold, until it all spirals out-of-control.

There are two ways to combat this: do not allow angry people to use the internet or make happy people click *even* more!

We at [spread-the.love](/) do not believe in exclusion therefore we aim to make happy people click more! But not pointless clicking on advertising or captchas to prove ones humanness, no we believe happy people should click to spread their happiness.

One click and you can make someone else feel good and happy about themselves, the people around them and the planet as a whole. Feel good that you have spread your happiness and have made others feel that happiness.

### How many clicks are allowed?

How much love can you spread? There cannot be enough love in the world, click as often as you like. You might have to reload the page as the button does become stuck as we reload our SMS account.

Sending SMS is not cheap but we do our best to send as many messages as possible.

<hr class="mt-5" width="30%"/>
### Can I select someone to send a message to?

No. Your happiness is sent to a random person somewhere living at a random location on this random planet.

If you wish to send someone specific a positive message, then do it using your device - in-particular if you have their contact details!

#### Do you send SMS in the middle of the night?

We ensure that people are not awoken from their sleep and send SMS only during *opening hours*. We at [spread-the.love](/) are rather liberal when these hours are and send SMS only between about 10am and 6pm local time.

<hr class="mt-5" width="30%"/>
### How do you fund this?

We have limited funds and when those funds have been drained, SMS are halted. If you wish to fund us, then send us a PayPal donation to our email: paypal@we.spread-the.love

### Are you hiring?

Not at the moment, but if you wish to contribute translations or ideas or code or coffee or happiness or positivity or a smile, then check out our codebase at [GitHub](https://github.com/stl-project).

### Is [spread-the.love](/) R2R technology?

We at [spread-the.love](/) believe in [DIY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_it_yourself) software and the [Right to Repair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_repair), if you find a bug or have a suggestion, then create a pull request at [GitHub](https://github.com/stl-project) or open an issue.

### I love the domain, can I get an email alias?

If you donate an amount above or equivalent to USD 100, as an acknowledge we will provide you with the opportunity to create an email alias with the domain \<your alias>@spreads-the.love (note: extra 's').

Provide us a list of your favourite aliases when you place your donation. Please be aware that your desired alias might have already been taken.

Note also we provide no email services other than a one-way email alias, i.e. spread-the.love does not provide an interface for send email using that email alias.

### Does spread-the.love aim to become an over-bloated multimillion dollar advertising-based corporation to be sold to the highest bidder, i.e. a larger multimillion advertising-based social media conglomerate to fulfil the desires of early investors?

No.

### Is this not just Effective Altruism?

No. We at [spread-the.love](/) have optimised [Effective Altruism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_altruism). Even though Effective Altruism is all about being efficient in the application of ones wealth and maximising ones returns on altruist acts, [spread-the.love](/) has optimised this extremely streamlined approach to altruism.

We at [spread-the.love](/) have removed the *effective*: [spread-the.love](/) is *altruism* technology.

### Do you have a contact email?

Yes, you can reach us at [do@you.spread-the.love](mailto:do@you.spread-the.love?subject=contact)
